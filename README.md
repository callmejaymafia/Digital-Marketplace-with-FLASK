Digital Marketplace Platform – Purpose

This project is a Flask-powered digital marketplace designed to enable creators to sell downloadable products such as ebooks, templates, music, graphics, source code, and other digital assets. The goal is to provide a simple, reliable, and secure platform where vendors can upload products, set pricing, and manage sales, while customers can browse, purchase, and instantly download the files they’ve paid for.

The core purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to build a real-world, production-ready marketplace system using Flask. It focuses on secure file delivery, user roles (vendor, buyer, admin), payment workflow architecture, and a clean Tailwind CSS interface. This project highlights practical backend engineering, modern UI design, and the essential logic behind digital product distribution platforms similar to Gumroad.
